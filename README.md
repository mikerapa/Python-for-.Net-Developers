## About Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted 
scripting language. Python was designed to be highly 
readable, with an emphasis on well-understood keywords, rather than
punctuation and special characters. Python uses fewer language constructs 
compared to other high-level programming languages.

Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python has been open source
from its inception. The language and its releases are managed by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/about/).

While there are multiple implementations of the Pythong language, CPython is by far the most popular. 
CPython is the reference implementation of the Python language. CPython is written in C and Python. 
Since the project is open source, you can view the code and there are ways to contribute to the project.

## Python's Growing Popularity 
Python has been growing in popularity, at a time of vast choices. By Some measures, Python is the
most popular programming language used today.

### Tiobe Index
The following chart shows the popularity of multiple programming languages, as measured by the [Tiobe Index.](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)
This data is from August 2023. According to the Tiobe Index, Python remains the most popular
programming language, sitting above languages like C and Java, which had previously been the most popular. 
See more about the Tiobe Index methodology [here](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/programminglanguages_definition/). 
This index has special criteria for determining what is a programming language. For example, HTML is not considered a 
programming language.

## Zen of Python
Python has a set of guiding principles, which are referred to as the Zen of Python. The following is a simplified 
version of those principles. You can see a more complete version [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python).
